        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            The Reuben sandwich is a North American grilled 
            sandwich composed of corned beef, Swiss cheese, 
            sauerkraut, and Thousand Island dressing or Russian 
            dressing, grilled between slices of rye bread. It is 
            associated with kosher-style delicatessens, but is 
            not kosher because it combines meat and cheese.
